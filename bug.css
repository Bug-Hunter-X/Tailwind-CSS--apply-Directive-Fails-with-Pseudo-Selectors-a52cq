This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector such as `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`. The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles for these pseudo-selectors, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, if you apply a class containing `hover:bg-blue-500`, the background color will not change on hover.  This is often exacerbated when combined with directives like `@responsive`.
